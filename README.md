# GCW Interoperability Guidelines Document

## Introduction
The purpose of the GCW Interoperability Guidelines (IOG) is to provide an overview of the GCW Data Portal and identify interoperability approaches that simplifies integration of data from a number of sources to a unified virtual data management system. 

Automatic processing from the srouce documents in ASCIIDOC to PDF and HTML is set up when changes to the documents are submitted. The most recent versions of the documentation is available below:

## How to build the PDF and HTML
ASCIIDOC documents can be converted into other formats using asciidoctor. This is available for both Linux and Windows environments. In order to create a PDF document asciidoctor-pdf is used. The Makefile in this repository will perform the conversion of the ASCIIDOC code to a PDF document provided you have access to asciidoctor.
